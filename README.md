# WeatherApp

Howdy, Partner. Welcome to my readme. There IS enough room for both of us in this town. 

This is my design pride and joy at the moment (3/17/23). This Weather App uses the OpenWeatherMap.org API to pull and display 3 hour forecast data including the current temperature, the dayâ€™s high, low, humidity percentage, and wind speed.

The design elements were inspired by 2022 trends, and overall simplicity so the weather cards can be cloned and easily turned into a 7 day forecast.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
